# Neural-Network-LP-Solve
This is an approach to solve an Integer LP problems using machine learning. LP problems are very random in nautre . I have tested various Machine Learning approached to verify the efficiencies of these models to solve 
highly random data. Concluding that the integer LP problems are not good problems to be solved using Machine Learning.
